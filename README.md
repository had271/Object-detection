# Object-detection
This project is about **real-time object detection** using OpenCV and Yolo11n.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- Ultralytics YOLO package (`pip install ultralytics`)

## How to Run

Make sure the following files are in your working directory:

- `yolo11n.pt` â€“ the pre-trained YOLO model file  
- The Python script for detection

When you run the python script, a window will open showing your webcam feed with detected objects.
